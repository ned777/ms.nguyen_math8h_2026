## How to Edit

### Change grading weights
Open `app.js` and find the `CATEGORIES` array at the top:
```js
const CATEGORIES = [
 { id: 'test', name: 'Tests', weight: 0.40, ... },
 { id: 'hw', name: 'Homework', weight: 0.30, ... },
 { id: 'cq', name: 'Quizzes', weight: 0.20, ... },
 { id: 'proj', name: 'Projects', weight: 0.10, ... },
];
```
Change the `weight` values — they must always add up to `1.0`.

### Change the grade scale
In `app.js`, find the `GRADES` array:
```js
const GRADES = [
 { letter: 'A', min: 90, ... },
 { letter: 'B', min: 80, ... },
 ...
];
```

### Change tip messages
In `app.js`, find the `TIPS` object and edit the text for any category:
```js
const TIPS = {
 test: ' Tip: ...',
 hw: ' Tip: ...',
 cq: ' Tip: ...',
 proj: ' Tip: ...',
};
```

### Change image size or border
In `style.css`, find `.teacher-img` and adjust `width`, `height`, or `border`.

### Change colors
In `style.css`, find the `:root` block at the top and edit the CSS variables:
```css
:root {
 --test: #6366f1; /* purple */
 --hw: #ec4899; /* pink */
 --cq: #0ea5e9; /* blue */
 --proj: #10b981; /* green */
 --grade-a: #10b981;
 --grade-b: #0ea5e9;
 --grade-c: #f59e0b;
